# Mein erstes Jupyter Book

Dies ist ein Test um zu prüfen, was ich alles tun muss, um das Buch nach
Änderungen auf GitHub Pages zu publizieren.

This is a small sample book to give you a feel for how book content is
structured.
It shows off a few of the major file types, as well as some sample content.
It does not go in-depth into any particular topic - check out [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for more information.

Check out the content pages bundled with this sample book to see more.
